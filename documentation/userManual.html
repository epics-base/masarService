<h2 class="nocount" id="abstract">Abstract</h2>

<p>MASAR (MAchine Snapshot, Archiving, and Retrieve) is an EPICS V4 service.
The server and client are implemented in C++ and Python. The server takes
machine snapshots, archives data in a relational database, and retrieves data
from the database. The client provides a GUI that retrieves data, compares data
with the live machine, and restores the machine with given snapshot data. The
client also provides support for other python and C++ code.</p>

<p>The server takes machine snapshot by using pre-defined configurations. To
take a snapshot the client specifies the name of the snapshot configuration and
a name for this snapshot event.When the server receives a command to take a
machine snapshot, the server retrieves, from the database, the list of V3
channel names for the configuration. It then gets the current value of all the
channels from V3 IOC, and saves the data as a snapshot event into the database.
</p>

<h2 class="nocount" id="status">Status of this Document</h2>

<p>This is the 2015-12-21 version of the MASAR User Manual. </p>

<h2 id="quickstart">Quick Start</h2>

<p>See the
<a href="https://github.com/epics-base/masarService/blob/debpkg/README.md">README</a>
for instructions for building/running MASAR.
</p>

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>MASAR is implemented in C++ and Python. Network communication is implemented
via the EPICS V4 channelRPC mechanism. </p>

<p>It currently supports SQLite3 and MongoDB as its database backend. A Python
module called PYMASAR provides access to backend database </p>

<p>Since EPICS V4 channelRPC server is implemented in C++, the interface
between the masar server and PYMASAR is implemented using Python/C. A Python
API is provided for the client user, and a default PyQt4 GUI is developed for
end user.</p>

<p>The products are all part of the <a
href="http://epics-pvdata.sourceforge.net">V4</a> implementation of <a
href="http://www.aps.anl.gov/epics">Experimental Physics and Industrial Control
System</a>, which are available via an <a
href="http://epics-pvdata.sourceforge.net/LICENSE.html">open source
license</a>. </p>

<p>The source code is available for free from github.</p>

<h2 id="note">NOTE </h2>

<p><ol>
  <li><b>In the database, time is stored as UTC/POSIX time started from Jan,
    1st, 1970. There is a constant time shift in second since the seconds past
    EPOCH used by EPICS V3 starts from Jan 1st, 1990. </b></li>
  <li><b>Since all time stored in the RDB is in the UTC time format, the client
    Python API returns all raw data, which means time is in UTC format. This
    impacts the API user. </b></li>
  <li><b>For the human being reading convenience, the default PyQt4 GUI
    displays it in local time. </b></li>
  <li><b>All timestamps in service_event, service_config, and pv_group tables
    are the time when inserting data into database. This means that the time
    stamp for a particular snapshot is the time when the data is inserted into
    database.</b></li>
  <li><b>Since the enum is converted to a string, it captures its label
    (display value) instead of its real value(0, 1, ...). Advantage doing that
    is if there is any changes on enum label, it probably means some V3 IOC
    database logic has changed. It is better to throw a message to show that
    explicitly. </b></li>
  <li><b>The compare and restore functions are provided only in PyQt4 GUI.
    Client user needs to use Python Client API to compare any sets of snapshot
    data, and manipulate the data. </b></li>
  <li><b>For restore function, instead of slowly and synchronously ramping the
    value to given setting point, the MASAR GUI sets the value whatever it is
    to the IOC directly. It might be dangerous if IOC or other gateway does not
    protect it. The restore function sets only the stored value back to IOC.
    </b></li>
  <li><b>The restore function does not verify a pv is a read-back or set-point.
    </b></li>
</ol>
 </p>

<h2 id="requirement">System Requirement</h2>

<p>To run MASAR on you machine, Python and various EPICS V3 and V4 run-time
library are required for both client and server. </p>

<p>Python: </p>
<ul> <li>Python 2.7 or above</li> </ul>
<b>Caveat:</b> Python 3.x has not been tested yet.
<p>EPICS modules: </p>
<ul>
  <li>EPICS Base: 3.14.x, and/or 3.15.x</li>
  <li><a href="http://epics-pvdata.sourceforge.net/">EPICS V4: </a>(>=4.5.0)<br>
 For R4.5.0, a patch is needed for pvDataCPP module as mentioned by 
 <a href="https://github.com/epics-base/pvDataCPP/issues/20">  
  issue #20 </a> of pvDataCPP repo. <br>
  A minimum set of V4 modules is listed as below:
    <ul>
      <li>pvDataCPP</li>
      <li>pvAccessCPP</li>
      <li>normativeTypes</li>
      <li>pvCommonCPP</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>For MASAR server, you need:</p>
<ul>
  <li>SQLite3 3.7 or above</li>
</ul>

<p>For MASAR client default GUI:</p>
<ul>
  <li>PyQt4 4.8 or above</li>
</ul>

<p>Currently, MASAR has been installed on the following systems:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Debian 8.0 (Jessie)</li>
  <li>Debian 7.0 (Wheezy)</li>
  <li>Ubuntu 11.04 (Natty Narwhal)</li>
  <li>Fedora 14</li>
  <li>Fedora 16</li>
  <li>Mac OS-X 10.6.8 (Snow Leopard)</li>
</ul>

<p></p>

<h2 id="terminology">Terminology</h2>
in addition to the terminology used by EPICS, MASAR defines the following: 
<ul>
  <li>pv group: A unique group.It has a name, list of V3 channel names,
    description, and date when group was created.</li>
  <li>service config: A unique configuration. It has a name, pv group name,
    description, and syatem to which system it belongs. </li>
  <li>system: Identifies the sub system to which each configuration
  belongs.</li>
  <li>service event: Description of a snapshot. It has comment, author name,
    date, and status;</li>
  <li>snapshot: The data for a snapshot event.</li>
  <li>interface name convention 
    <ul>
      <li>putXXXX(): put into a live machine, more specifically, an EPICS live
        pv</li>
      <li>getXXXX(): get from a live machine, more specifically, an EPICS live
        pv</li>
      <li>saveXXX(): save into a RDB</li>
      <li>retrieveXXX(): retrieve from a RDB</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="architecture">System Architecture</h2>
The MASAR consists of client and server : 

<table>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td><img src="masar/masar.png" height="360" width="480"></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td style="text-align: center;">MASAR Architecture</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>The client has a client Python API library, which can be used by both Python
scripting, and the GUI. A default PyQt4 GUI is developed for data viewing,
snapshot taking, comparing a snapshot with live machine, and restoring machine
to a particular status using a snapshot. </p>

<p>The server has 4 layers: </p>
<ul>
  <li>Service communication control: the pvAccess channel RPC instance.</li>
  <li>Service: parses a command from the client, implements desired action, and
    returns the result to the client.</li>
  <li>Channel Access Client: For now the only usage to to get the current value
    of a set of V3 channels.</li>
  <li>DSL (data source layer): This is the interface between C++ and Python. 
    <ul>
      <li>PYMASAR: A Python module to access SQLite3/MongoDB database.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Data layer. 
    <ul>
      <li>IOC: live machine data;</li>
      <li>MASAR: embedded inside PYMASAR, which is dedicated to MASAR
      service.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="server">MASAR Server</h2>
The MASAR server can take a snapshot for any combination of EPICS channels,
including scalar channels of type string, enum, byte (8-bit), short (16-bit),
int (32-bit), long (which is same with integer in EPICS V3), float, and double,
and/or waveform/array pv with any above types except enum. Since the data types
supported by both Python and SQLite3/MongoDB are string, int, and real, the types
are casted as below: 

<table>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td style="text-align: center;">epics data type</td>
      <td style="text-align: center;">data type carried by MASAR</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td style="text-align: center;">enum, string</td>
      <td style="text-align: center;">string</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td style="text-align: center;">byte, short, int/long</td>
      <td style="text-align: center;">long</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td style="text-align: center;">float, double</td>
      <td style="text-align: center;">double</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
The waveform data is casted following above rule, and stored as a BLOB in
database after being serialized into binary. At current stage, the BLOB is one
field of masar_data table, and might be separated as a standalone table if
there is any performance issue. 

<h3 id="functions">Functions </h3>

<p></p>

<p>The MASAR server side supports 6 fundamental functions to talk with RDB: </p>
<ol>
  <li><b>retrieveServiceConfigProps</b>: current MASAR database schema defines
    an associated property table, service_config_prop, to host some user
    defined properties. One typical use is which sub-system one particular
    configuration belongs to. This function is to get a full list of sub-system
    that are defined for MASAR service in database. </li>
  <li><b>retrieveServiceConfigs</b>: get a list of the snapshot configurations
    with filter based on snapshot names.</li>
  <li><b>retrieveServiceEvents</b>: get a list how many snapshot events have
    been taken with filters based on snapshot names, author, and time
  range.</li>
  <li><b>retrieveSnapshot</b>: get real snapshot data;</li>
  <li><b>saveSnapshot</b>: save a snapshot into database;</li>
  <li><b>updateSnapshotEvent</b>: update a particular snapshot, for example
    flag a snapshot as approved;</li>
</ol>
Function <b>NOT supported</b> by the server: 
<ol>
  <li>Comparing two different snapshots. This is a function inside client part,
    and user can do it using Python interface.</li>
  <li>Comparing an archived snapshot with current live machine. This is a
    function inside client part, and is supported in PyQt4 GUI by default.</li>
  <li>Restoring machine to a particular snapshot status. The MASAR server has
    unidirectional access to EPICS V3 IOC, which means reads value only.
    Restoring is a function inside client part, and is supported in PyQt4 GUI
    by default.</li>
  <li>Change pv name. We thought about pv name changes, but do not support this
    function at current release.</li>
  <li>Add new pv name to existing configuration. We thought about adding a new
    pv name to a group, but do not support it at current release. Since adding
    a new pv is changing the configuration definition in fact, it is encouraged
    to create a new configuration. Please refer "Database configuration"
    section about how to create a new configuration. User is encouraged to
    define a new configuration, then ask service manager or database
    administrator to load the configuration into database. </li>
  <li>Reuse configuration name. We have a request that new group maintains old
    group name and old group becomes deprecated. But this is not in the initial
    implementation.</li>
  <li>Version control for configuration changes. We considered to adopt version
    control to tracking configuration changes, for example, adding a new pv to
    existing pv_group, changing group name, and so on. But this is not in the
    initial implementation.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="dataformat">Data Format </h3>

<p>When a MASAR request is sent from client to server, NTNameValue type is used
to carry parameters, which is as below: </p>
<pre>structure NTNameValue
   string[]    names
   string[]    values
   string      function xxxxxx // function name as above</pre>
The name/value pair is converted into a Python dictionary inside service layer,
and transferred to PYMASAR layer. Acceptable names for above 6
functions are listed as below: 
<pre>retrieveServiceConfigProps:
        names = ["propname", "servicename", "configname"]
retrieveServiceConfigs:
        names = ["servicename", "configname", "system"]
retrieveServiceEvents:
        names = ["configid", "start", "end", "comment", "user"]
retrieveSnapshot: 
        names = ["eventid", "start", "end", "comment"]
saveSnapshot:
        names = ["servicename","configname","comment"]
updateSnapshotEvent:
        names = ["eventid", "user", "desc"]</pre>

<p>The server return either a NTTable, or NTMultiChannel. </p>

<h2 id="database">Relational Database </h2>

<h3 id="sqlite3">SQLite3 Schema </h3>
Currently, SQLite3 is the only database supported by MASAR service. Its
original schema is inherited from IRMIS, and now is as below: 

<table>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td><img src="masar/masar-sqlite-eer.png" height="360" width="480"></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td style="text-align: center;">MASAR SQLite3 Schema</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<h3 id="configdb">Database configuration </h3>

<p>Configuration may be loaded into a database from a set of text files
using the masarConfigTool.</p>

<p>The following is an example showing how to configure MASAR database.</p>

<p>Site-specific information is configured in JSON text file, which has format as
below:</p>
<pre>
cat &lt;&lt;EOF &gt;db_config.txt
{
 "pvgroups": {
    "test":         ["example.txt", "server test"],
    "wftest":       ["exampleWf.txt", "server test with waveform"],
    "bigwftest":    ["exampleBigWf.txt", "server test with big waveform"]
 }. "configs": {
    "sr_test":      ["test pv config", "test"],
    "wf_test":      ["waveform test pv config", "test"],
    "bwf_test":     ["big waveform test pv config", "test"]
 }, "pvg2config": {
    "sr_test":   ["test"],
    "wf_test":   ["wftest"],
    "bwf_test":  ["wftest", "bigwftest"]
 }
}
EOF
</pre>

<p>There are 3 variables defined in settings.py </p>
<ol>
  <li><b>pvgroups</b>. A Python dictionary with group name as key. Each pv
    group is a collection of V3 channel names. The value is a the name of a
    file that holds a list of channel names and configuration description. The
    pv group name has to be global unique.</li>
  <li><b>configs</b>. It is a Python dictionary with configure name as key.
    Each config has a Python list as its value, which includes configure
    description, and which system it belongs to. The config name has to be
    global unique. </li>
  <li><b>pvg2config</b>. It is a Python dictionary with configure name as key.
    The value of each key is a collection list of pv group name. </li>
</ol>

<p>After the settings.py is configured, configmasardb.py creates the database.
Assume the database is called masar.db, and is located in
masarService/example</p>
<pre>$ python ../python/pymasarsqlite/db/configmasardb.py</pre>
it requests the absolute path of pv list file directory. 
<pre>Please give absolute ROOT PATH of your pv list files
[default: /full/path/to/pvs]:</pre>
here give the pv list directory PATH, for example
/full/path/to/pvs: 
<pre><span style="color: rgb(204, 0, 0);">/full/path/to/pvs</span>
Use new ROOT: /full/path/to/pvs</pre>

<p>If the path is wrong, it raises an exception. After loading pv names into
database, it tries to save configuration. If a configuration exists already, it
reports for example, and ignores that configuration:</p>
<pre>configuration name (bwf_test) exists already.
configuration name (sr_test) exists already.
configuration name (wf_test) exists already.</pre>

<p>After finished the database configuration, it is ready to launch MASAR
server.</p>

<h2 id="installation">Install from source</h2>

<p>At current stage, all EPICS V4 packages are available as source code, which
can be checked out from by sourceforge mercurial repository. To compile all V4
module Python 2.7 and EPICS V3 development packages must be installed. EPICS V3
base is available as a Debian package from <a
href="http://epics.nsls2.bnl.gov/debian/">NSLS-II Debian package server</a>.
Here we assume EPICS V3 base is installed under <span
style="color: rgb(0, 153, 0);">/usr/lib/epics</span>.</p>

<p>A step-by-step installation is introduced here, and the example is to show
how to install whole packages on Ubuntu 11.04 x86_64 system. You should be able
to install all modules on other systems following the same procedure. You can
check your system architecture using for example on linux: </p>
<pre>$ uname -m
x86_64</pre>

<h3 id="prepareinstall">Preparation</h3>
Here let's assume that the EPICS Base is installed under <strong>/usr/lib/epics</strong>,
<br>
and all V4 modules are under <strong>/usr/lib/epics/V4</strong>. 

<p>If you are inside an internal network, and have some proxy setting, you
might hit a connection error during cloning a module like:</p>
<pre>abort: error: Connection refused</pre>

<p>Please consulate your network manager, or you can try to set your http_proxy
environment, for example, on BASH shell:</p>
<pre>export http_proxy=http://your.proxy.server.name:port</pre>
NOTE: Make sure you have following line in each module in configure/RELEASE.
Suggest to put it as the last line if it is not. 
<pre>-include $(TOP)/configure/RELEASE.local</pre>

<h3 id="pvdatainstall">Install EPICS V4 </h3>
The latest MASAR needs EPICS V4 R4.5.0 and above. For R4.5.0, a patch is needed for
pvDataCPP module as discussed in <a href="https://github.com/epics-base/pvDataCPP/issues/20">  
  issue #20 </a> of pvDataCPP repo.
<br>
User can follow the instruction of <a href="http://epics-pvdata.sourceforge.net/gettingStarted.html">
Getting Started</a> with EPICS V4 <a href="http://epics-pvdata.sourceforge.net/gettingStarted.html#c++_development">
section 3</a> to compile the needed V4 modules.

<h3 id="masarinstall">Install masarService</h3>

Get latest from its github repo:
<pre>$ hg clone https://github.com/epics-base/masarService.git
$ cd masarService
</pre>
Verify the following to RELEASE.local (example for Debian 8 with above install assumption):

<pre>PYTHON=python2.7
PYTHON_BASE=/usr
$(PYTHON)_DIR = $(PYTHON_BASE)/lib/$(PYTHON)/config-x86_64-linux-gnu

EV4_BASE=/usr/lib/epics/V4
PVACLIENT=$(EV4_BASE)/pvaClientCPP
PVDATABASE=$(EV4_BASE)/pvDatabaseCPP
PVASRV=$(EV4_BASE)/pvaSrv
PVACCESS=$(EV4_BASE)/pvAccessCPP
NORMATIVETYPES=$(EV4_BASE)/normativeTypesCPP
PVDATA=$(EV4_BASE)/pvDataCPP
PVCOMMON=$(EV4_BASE)/pvCommonCPP
EPICS_BASE=/usr/lib/epics
</pre>

<p><b>Caveat:</b> 
<ol>
  <li>On multi-arch systems, the <tt>/lib/</tt> directory part
      might have to be replaced with a different string, including the architecture
      name triplet. E.g., <tt>/lib/x86-linux-gnu/</tt>;</li>
  <li>On different systems, <tt>/config-x86_64-linux-gnu</tt>  directory part might have 
      to be replaced with a different string. E.g., <tt>/config</tt>.</li>
</ol>

</p>

<p>After that, execute </p>
<pre>$ make</pre>

<p>The installation procedure is complete if the above is successful.</p>

<p>If it hits a problem like</p>
<pre> fatal error: Python.h: No such file or directory</pre>
it means the python devel library is not installed. Please check your system,
and install missing library. For example, on a debian dist: 
<pre>sudo apt-get install python2.7-dev</pre>

<h2 id="runserver">Run MASAR Server</h2>

<p>After installing all required modules and configuring the sql database the
last step is to prepare and check the Python environment.</p>

<h3 id="pythonpath">PYTHONPATH</h3>
The PYTHONPATH must be defined as follows. It could be defined in .bash_profile 
<pre>$ export PYTHONPATH=/usr/lib/epics/V4/masarService/python
$ export PYTHONPATH=${PYTHONPATH}:/usr/lib/epics/V4/masarService/cpp/src/python</pre>

<h3 id="masardb">MASAR SQLite database</h3>
You also need to set the MASAR_SQLITE_DB to allow PYMASAR module to find the
SQLite3 database. Here is an example. It can also be put in .bash_profile 
<pre>$ export MASAR_SQLITE_DB=/usr/lib/epics/V4/masarService/example/masar.db</pre>

<p>Now it is ready to go.</p>

<h3 id="launchserver">Launch MASAR service</h3>

<p>The following packages are needed to run MASAR server.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Python 2.7 or above</li>
  <li>SQLite3 3.7 or above</li>
</ul>
<pre>$ cd /usr/lib/epics/V4/masarService/cpp
$ ./bin/linux-x86_64/masarServiceRun</pre>
You will see the following output 
<pre>Using SQLite as backend.

<h3 id="launchserver2">Launch MASAR with other name</h3>
Above description explains how to launch MASAR service with default name. Since
a client uses the name to communicate with server, the server name can be given
when launching it as below, for example to name the RPC channel as
"MASARSERVICE:TEST:EXAMPLE": 
<pre>$ cd /usr/lib/epics/V4/masarService/cpp
$ ./bin/linux-x86_64/masarServiceRun MASARSERVICE:TEST:EXAMPLE</pre>
it will shows 
<pre>Using SQLite as backend.

<h2 id="masarclient">MASAR Client</h2>

<p>There are 2 ways to use MASAR client, using either the Python API or the
default PyQt4 GUI.</p>

<h3 id="pythonapi">Python API</h3>
The client API is defined in masarClient.py. 
<ol>
  <li>client.<b>retrieveSystemList</b>()</li>

  <p>Retrieve all system and return as a list, or False if failed. An
  example:</p>

  <p>Example:</p>
  <pre>import sys

from masarclient import masarClient
from masarclient.channelRPC import epicsExit

# Assume the service name is masarService
# Consulate server manager to confirm it.
channel='masarService'

# initialize a masar client
mc = masarClient.client( channelname = channel)

# retrieve all system defined in masar configuration
print '==== retrieve system list ===='
result = mc.retrieveSystemList()
print result

# Call this function before exit.
sys.exit(epicsExit())</pre>
  <li>client.<b>retrieveServiceConfigs</b>(params) </li>

  <p>Retrieve all configuration information. The params is as a dictionary
  which can have any combination of the following keys:<br>
  key names: </p>
  <pre>["servicename", "configname", "system"]</pre>
  It returns all configurations that satisfies the search constrains, or False
  if failed:<br>

  <pre>config id []
config name []
config description []
version []</pre>
  The version is a reserved function for future. 

  <p>Example:</p>
  <pre>import sys

from masarclient import masarClient
from masarclient.channelRPC import epicsExit

# Assume the service name is masarService
# Consulate server manager to confirm it.
channel='masarService'

# retrieve all configuration with given constrains
# In this example, all configurations belonging to system "LTD2"
# are retrieved from RDB.
print '==== retrieve service config ===='
params = {'system': 'LTD2'}
result = mc.retrieveServiceConfigs(params)
print result

# Call this function before exit.
sys.exit(epicsExit())</pre>
  <li>client.<b>retrieveServiceEvents</b>(params)</li>

  <p>Retrieve all events including event id, user comment, user name, and UTC
  time.<br>
  It retrieves all events without any V3 IOC data. The params is as a
  dictionary which can have any combination of the following keys:<br>
  key names:</p>
  <pre>["configid", "start", "end", "comment", "user"]</pre>

  <p>The value of each key needs to be a string. The "start" and "end" is for
  time range in UTC format.<br>
  It returns all event list that satisfies the search constrains, or False if
  failed:</p>
  <pre>event id []
event description []
UTC date time  []
author/user []</pre>

  <p>Example:</p>
  <pre>import sys

from masarclient import masarClient
from masarclient.channelRPC import epicsExit

# Assume the service name is masarService
# Consulate server manager to confirm it.
channel='masarService'

# retrieve all events list with given constrains
# In this example, all events belonging to configuration which has configid ("1")
# are returned.
print '==== retrieve service config ===='
params = {'configid': '1'}
result = mc.retrieveServiceEvents(params)
print result

# Call this function before exit.
sys.exit(epicsExit())</pre>
  <li>client.<b>retrieveSnapshot</b>(params)</li>

  <p>Retrieve a particular snapshot, which is flagged to be an approved
  snapshot, with all pv data.<br>
  The params is as a dictionary which can have any combination of the following
  keys:<br>
  key names:</p>
  <pre>["eventid", "start", "end", "comment"]</pre>

  <p>The value of each key needs to be a string. The "start" and "end" is for
  time range in UTC format.<br>
  It returns snapshot that satisfies the search constrains, or False if
  failed:</p>
  <pre>pv name []
string value []
double value []
long value []
dbr_type []
isConnected []
secondsPastEpoch []
nanoSeconds []
alarmSeverity []
alarmStatus []
is_array []
array_value [[]]</pre>

  <p>For a scalar pv, its value is carried in string, double and long. For a
  waveform/array, its value is carried in array_value. Client needs to check
  the pv is an array by checking is_array, and check its data type by checking
  dbr_type.</p>
  <pre>        # DBR_TYPE definition defined in db_access.h
        #define DBF_STRING      0
        #define DBF_INT         1
        #define DBF_SHORT       1
        #define DBF_FLOAT       2
        #define DBF_ENUM        3
        #define DBF_CHAR        4
        #define DBF_LONG        5
        #define DBF_DOUBLE      6
        #define DBF_NO_ACCESS   7

        # type mapping in python
        epicsLong   =   [1, 4, 5]
        epicsString =   [0, 3]
        epicsDouble =   [2, 6]
        epicsNoAccess = [7]</pre>

  <p>Example:</p>
  <pre>import sys

from masarclient import masarClient
from masarclient.channelRPC import epicsExit

# Assume the service name is masarService
# Consulate server manager to confirm it.
channel='masarService'

# retrieve snapshot data which event id = "1"
# It return false if there isn't such snapshot.
print '==== retrieve snapshot ===='
params = {'eventid': '1'}
result = mc.retrieveSnapshot(params)
print result

# Call this function before exit.
sys.exit(epicsExit())</pre>
  <li>client.<b>saveSnapshot</b>(params)</li>

  <p>This function is to take a machine preview. It gives user a opportunity to
  confirm whether the snapshot is good or not. The data will be saved into
  database with a default flag to identify that this preview is not approved by
  the user yet. The params is as a dictionary which can have any combination of
  the following keys:<br>
  (key names):</p>
  <pre>["servicename","configname","comment"]</pre>
  The value of each key needs to be a string. It saves all data into database,
  and returns the same data back to the client, which means the return data is
  same the retrieveSnapshot function. 

  <p>Example:</p>
  <pre>import sys

from masarclient import masarClient
from masarclient.channelRPC import epicsExit

# Assume the service name is masarService
# Consulate server manager to confirm it.
channel='masarService'

# get a machine preview and save it into database
# for configuration with name = 'LTD2_SC_Daily_All'
print '==== machine preview snapshot ===='
params = {'configname': 'LTD2_SC_Daily_All',
          'servicename': 'masar'}
result = mc.saveSnapshot(params)
print result

# Call this function before exit.
sys.exit(epicsExit())</pre>
  <li>client.<b>updateSnapshotEvent</b>(params)</li>

  <p>Flag a particular snapshot to be approved..<br>
  The params is as a dictionary which can have any combination of the following
  keys:<br>
  key names:</p>
  <pre>["eventid", "user", "desc"]</pre>
  The value of each key needs to be a string. It returns True if succeeded,
  otherwise, false. 

  <p>Example:</p>
  <pre>import sys

from masarclient import masarClient
from masarclient.channelRPC import epicsExit

# Assume the service name is masarService
# Consulate server manager to confirm it.
channel='masarService'

# approve a machine preview which event id = '1'
# it returns false if there is no event found with id='1'
print '==== approve machine preview snapshot ===='
params = {'eventid':    '1',
          'user':       'test',
          'desc':       'this is a good snapshot, and I approved it.'}
result = mc.updateSnapshotEvent(params)
print result

# Call this function before exit.
sys.exit(epicsExit())</pre>
  <li>client.<b>getLiveMachine</b>(params)</li>

  <p>Get live data with given pv list. Following the same params format, it
  uses pv name as both key and value. It returns</p>
  <pre>pv name []
string value []
double value []
long value []
dbr_type []
isConnected []
is_array []
array_value [[]]</pre>
  Same as retrieveSnapshot function, for a scalar pv, its value is carried in
  string, double and long. For a waveform/array, its value is carried in
  array_value. Client needs to check the pv is an array by checking is_array,
  and check its data type by checking dbr_type. 

  <p>Example:</p>
  <pre>import sys

from masarclient import masarClient
from masarclient.channelRPC import epicsExit

# Assume the service name is masarService
# Consulate server manager to confirm it.
channel='masarService'

# get a live machine with given pv list
print '==== get live machine ===='
pvlist = ['LTB-BI{BPM:1}LTB:MbAvgX-I',
          'LTB-BI{BPM:1}LTB:MbStdX-I',
          'LTB-BI{BPM:1}LTB:MbAvgY-I',
          'LTB-BI{BPM:1}LTB:MbStdY-I',
          'LTB-BI{BPM:1}LTB:Iavg-Calc',
          'LTB-BI{BPM:1}LTB:Istd-Calc',
          'LTB-BI{BPM:1}Rate:Update-SP',
          'LTB-BI{BPM:2}LTB:MbAvgX-I',
          'LTB-BI{BPM:2}LTB:MbStdX-I',
          'LTB-BI{BPM:2}LTB:MbAvgY-I',
          'LTB-BI{BPM:2}LTB:MbStdY-I',
          'LTB-BI{BPM:2}LTB:Iavg-Calc',
          'LTB-BI{BPM:2}LTB:Istd-Calc',
          'LTB-BI{BPM:2}Rate:Update-SP']

# formalize the params
for pv in pvlist:
    params[pv] = pv
result = mc.getLiveMachine(params)
print result

# Call this function before exit.
sys.exit(epicsExit())</pre>
</ol>

<h3 id="clientgui">Default GUI</h3>
A default GUI is developed using PyQt4. A start script can be found under
masarService. By default, client GUI can be launched by:
<pre>$ python masar</pre>

If the server started with the name another name, MASARSERVICE:TEST:EXAMPLE for example, 
client GUI can be launched as below: 
<pre>$ python masar MASARSERVICE:TEST:EXAMPLE</pre>
