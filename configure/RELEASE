# RELEASE - Location of external support modules
#
# IF YOU CHANGE this file or any file it includes you must
# do a "gnumake rebuild" in the application's top level directory.
#
# The build process does not check dependencies against files
# that are outside this application, thus you should also do a
# "gnumake rebuild" in the top level directory after EPICS_BASE
# or any other external module pointed to below is rebuilt.
#
# Host- or target-specific settings can be given in files named
#  RELEASE.$(EPICS_HOST_ARCH).Common
#  RELEASE.Common.$(T_A)
#  RELEASE.$(EPICS_HOST_ARCH).$(T_A)

TEMPLATE_TOP=$(EPICS_BASE)/templates/makeBaseApp/top

# EPICS V4 Developers: Do not edit the locations in this file!
#
# To create a file RELEASE.local in this directory
#     copy ExampleRELEASE.local to RELEASE.local
#     edit RELEASE.local
#     rebuild
