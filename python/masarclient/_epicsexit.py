"""
This function should only be called right before Python exit.
It will make sure epicsExitCallAtExits() be called if there is any registered.
Python will crash without this call but there is any registered.
 
epicsExit() will completely shut down the EPICS library silently. It should be called after Python
exit handler if there is any epics related stuff reqistered as Python atexit function to make
sure the right clean up order, for example is cothread. 
Otherwise, it could cause an exception if allowing normal Python exist processing after calling 
epicsExit().

Planning: it would be better to call epicsExit() function instead of epicsExitCallAtExits().
